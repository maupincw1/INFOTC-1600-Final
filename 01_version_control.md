# What Is Version Control?

Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time. It allows you to:
- Save snapshots of your project  
- Go back to older versions  
- Work on different features without breaking your main work  
- Collaborate with others easily  

Git is the most popular version control system used today, and GitHub is where Git repositories can be stored and shared online.
